    "Hey! I'm Kanishq, a 16 year old high school student that loves programming.",
    "I'm currently looking for a programming internship at Discord because I'm a huge fan of the community and I want to help make it a better place for everyone.",
    "Some more info about me: I'm male and I was born in India, but I currently live in the US with permanent residence.",
    "I'm currently a junior in high school, but I spend most of my free time either working on Ilios Labs or chatting with my friends on Discord.",
    "Some of my other hobbies include playing ping pong, leading the programmers of my FRC robotics club, and learning about science and technology.",
    "I also work as a web developer for a learning center near me, and I'm the primary maintainer for their website.",

      "response": "So...why do I think I'm fit for a company like Discord? Well, for starters, I've been programming for over 7 years, trying new languages like Python, Javascript, and HTML/CSS.",
      "responded": true
    },
    "Now, that might not be too impressive on its own but I've taught them all to myself using online courses and creating projects to jump right into the language, which you can see on my Github.",
    "I love solving difficult problems and overcoming those kinds of obstacles in my projects",
    "I'm also a team worker. I'm always looking for feedback or criticism from others so I can improve myself and take a look at things from a different view.",
    "My whole quest as a programmer is to make people's lives easier, which is why I started Ilios Labs, and over the past few years, I've integrated Discord heavily into my workflow because of how convenient it makes communicating with my friends and getting help from others."

      "response": "This may seem like an exaggeration, but Discord honestly started my quest to become a developer",
      "responded": true
    },
    "I've always wanted to find a career in computer science, but being on Discord made me want to actively start working on my own projects and learning more about developing.",
    "In February of 2021, I watched a video by this youtuber, Polymars, and it genuinely inspired something within me. I realized how much I could do with Java, the only language I knew at that point, and I was really excited to make my own Discord Bot.",
    "Before that, I had only known Java from online classes, but I was finally motivated to do my own thing.",
    "The discovery that it was that easy to create something with my code and help people was super motivating and it essentially just snowballed from there, leading me to the place where I am now.",
    "I'd like to think that this story is not only my developing \"origin story\", but it also goes to show how much I've learned in just one year of actively developing."

    "If I was selected for the position, I'd be able to come up with creative ideas and I could help implement features that the community really wants, whether it's for all of Discord or just the developers.",
    "One of the ways I think Discord could be improved is in decreasing the learning curve required to begin using Discord. I have a lot of friends that try to use Discord because they know how popular it is, but it just takes too long for them to get acclimated to the UI and understand what features are available to them.",
    "Another thing I would like to work on is making the developer documentation easier to understand, and perhaps adding examples of using certain features."

    "I created a Discord Bot that uses an API to compile code and also create pastes using PasteBin. It accepts inputs, over 20 languages, and uses the latest Discord features to make it a great experience.",
    "That's just an example of something cool that I've made, but I've also made some really cool websites and programs, like https://bubble.ilioslabs.dev, and this one.",
    "Another project I'm really proud of is Monad, a web app that I created to help people share and discover code snippets.",
    "I made it because Github Gists and Codegrepper didn't really serve the purpose I wanted. Monad is going to evolve into a suite of products, including the website, a VSCode extension, a Discord bot, and even more.",
    "In all of these projects, I've had to overcome different challenges like learning new languages and frameworks, getting better at writing clean code, and all of those bugs that I've had to deal with.",
    "I taught myself how to do most of these things, including designing and building a website, and I'm really proud of how I've done it.",
