    "Hey! I'm Kanishq, a 16 year old high school student that loves programming.",
    "I'm currently a junior in high school, but I spend most of my free time either working on Ilios Labs or chatting with my friends on Discord.",
    "I also work as a web developer for a learning center near me, and I'm the primary maintainer for their website.",
    "I'm currently looking for a programming position at Discord because I'm a huge fan of the community and I want to help make it a better place for everyone.",
    "To get a download of my cover letter, press the skip button on the top right and press the 'Download' button. To view my resume, check out my personal website at https://neesh.ilioslabs.dev/resume",
    "So...why do I think I'm fit for a company like Discord? Well, for starters, I've been programming for over 7 years, trying new languages like Python, Javascript, and HTML/CSS.",
    "Now, that might not be too impressive on its own but I've taught them all to myself using online courses and creating projects to jump right into the language, which you can see on my Github.",
    "I love solving difficult problems and overcoming those kinds of obstacles in my projects",
    "I'm also a team worker. I hate working on things alone and I'm always looking for feedback or criticism from others so I can improve myself and take a look at things from a different view.",
    "My whole quest as a programmer is to make people's lives easier, which is why I started Ilios Labs, and over the past few years, I've integrated Discord heavily into my workflow because of how convenient it makes communicating with my friends and getting help from others.",
    "What projects have I created, you might be asking. Well, I can show you!",
    "I created a Discord Bot that uses an API to compile code and also create pastes using PasteBin. It accepts inputs, over 20 languages, and uses the latest Discord features to make it a great experience.",
    "I can create a simple code snippet here and show you...",
    "codeconsole.log(\"Hello World!\")",
    "Now, I can use a context menu to compile this code.",

    "Check out Codetta at https://github.com/Neesh774/Codetta",
    "That's just an example of something cool that I've made, but I've also made some really cool websites and programs, like https://bubble.ilioslabs.dev, and this one.",
    "Another project I'm really proud of is Monad, a web app that I created to help people share and discover code snippets.",
    "I made it because Github Gists and Codegrepper didn't really serve the purpose I wanted. Monad is going to evolve into a suite of products, including the website, a VSCode extension, a Discord bot, and even more.",
    "In all of these projects, I've had to overcome different challenges like learning new languages and frameworks, getting better at writing clean code, and all of those bugs that I've had to deal with.",
    "I taught myself how to do most of these things, including designing and building a website, and I'm really proud of how I've done it.",
    "You can check out all of my open source projects on Github, and all of the tech stacks and languages I've used and learned at my main website, https://neesh.ilioslabs.dev",
    "I learned about this opportunity through Twitter and the jobs page on your website, and I realized that working with you is a great way to learn new things and grow as a developer.",
    "As for a salary expectation, I'm hoping to earn about $20-30 per hour, but I'm open to any offer.",
    "This experience will also be one of my first experiences working in a company with experienced developers, so I'm looking forward to learning how to act in a workplace and how to work with others.",
    "I'm proficient at using Git as well, but not how to use it in a working environment because I've only really used it for personal projects so far.",
    "I'm open to interviews for this internship or any other opportunity that I might be able to fit into, but I'm aiming at the Bots and API team position, because I have a lot of experience with full stack experience and I'm very interested in creating tools for developers.",
    "I also have my sights set on the full stack engineering position because I think I could fill that role pretty well.",
    "Please feel free to email me, call/text me, or send me a DM to ãƒ„CheesyNeeshãƒ„#5076 if you have any questions or concerns.",
    "That's it! Thank you for staying around to check out this website, and I can't wait to hear your response."
